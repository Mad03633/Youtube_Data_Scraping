# YouTube Video Data Analysis

## Overview

This project is focused on scraping, processing, and analyzing YouTube video data. The primary objective is to categorize videos based on their durations and visualize the distribution of these categories. The analysis is carried out using Python libraries such as `BeautifulSoup` for web scraping and `Seaborn` for data visualization.

## Features

### Web Scraping
- The project uses `BeautifulSoup` to scrape YouTube video data such as durations, titles, and view counts.

### Data Processing
- Extracts and processes video durations to categorize videos into two categories:
  - **Mini-Videos**: Videos shorter than 15 minutes.
  - **Long-Videos**: Videos longer than 15 minutes.

### Data Visualization
- Visualizes the count of **Mini-Videos** and **Long-Videos** using `Seaborn`. The colors are customized using the `palette` option.
